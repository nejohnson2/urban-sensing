      "###Playgrounds vs Water\n",
      "for example, photos of playgrounds to prove the playgrounds exist vs water quality.  These are two differnt problems which both need 'data' but a very differnt type of data.  Furthermore, it is much more challenging to collect some data than others.  There is the scientific method to actually collecting data in order to rule out factors such as contamiation, bias etc..  These are things you dont need to worry about when working with photo data...for example\n",
      "\n",
      "- Therefore these two cases are not the same.  **Water quality is really complex** and measuring something and making it actionable is a lengthy process.\n",

      "###Engagement vs Collecting data\n",
      "On one hand you want people to participate.  Participation can lead to greater data collection and disemination or ideas/processes etc...  For this, sometimes the barrier needs to be lowered for participation.  This can be different than raising awareness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The challenge in citizen science is to not let people down because of poor data collection which results from the limitations of sensor technologies.  There needs to be engagement but balanced with quality.  This is always the argument in citizen science.  Perhaps the focus should be on sensor technologies which in fact open up the possibilities for better parcipation from the public.\n",

      "### Temporary Expert\n",
      "There is a dividing line that sensors run in letting people be a temporary expert.  A sensor can enable someone to collect data about a specific topic though this does not necessarily mean that they understand the topic.  For example, hydrology is a very complicated field and is needed to really understand the complexities of water quality.  Just taking a reading does not mean you're an expert.  On the other side of that coin, the sensor itself can enable people who do not understand the topic to actually go out an measure something useful.\n",
